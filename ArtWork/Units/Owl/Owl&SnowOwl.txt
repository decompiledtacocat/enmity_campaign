Owl & Snow Owl

Description:
The hi-poly versions of the owls.

I modified the Snowy Owl portrait model so it could be
used properly. No crappy portrait glow behind them, plus
three necessary attachments were added. And don't forget
the best....the models have no custom textures. ;)

Even if it's an easy modified model, you must give
credits if you use the models in your map.

Enjoy! ;)

Directories:
No need for directories for these models. ;P
