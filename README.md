# enmity_campaign + Naga Map
enmity campaign from warcraft 3: tft

Hi this is TekkVicious creator of enmity campaign.
When I stopped this project I made the mistake of not open sourcing.
Here it is today open sourced for anyone.

Additionally, there is a folder called "Naga" which was an early attempt of mine to add 4th Naga race to TFT.

Its been 15 years, but if you have any questions feel free to ask:
