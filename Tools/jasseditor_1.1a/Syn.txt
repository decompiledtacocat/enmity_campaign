; Syntax:

;   @COLOR
;     Starts a new syntax set.
;     COLOR can either be the name of a color starting with "cl"
;     Or it can be $BBGGRR
;       Where BB is Blue, GG green and RR red - in hexadecimals
    

;     Example syntax declarations that work:
;       @clRed, @clBlue, @clGreen, @clGrayText, @clMaroon, @clBtnFace, @$20CCFF

;     Example syntax declarations that doesn't work:
;       @Red, @Blue, @ffffcc, @ clGreen, clBlue

;   !COMMAND
;     Commands are "bold", "italic", "underline" and "nocase". (without the "quotes")
;     They will apply to the last declared syntax
;     "nocase" will disable case sensivity

;     Commands that work:
;       !bold, !italic, !underline, !nocase

;     Examples that doesn't work:
;       ! bold, !"bold"

;   ;Comment
;     Lines where the first character is ; are comments, and are ignored

;     Note that this is will not work!
;       @clBlack ;Block Builders

;     It ONLY works if the FIRST character on the line is ;

;   (any word)
;     All other words will be added to the last declared syntax

;   Strings and Comment colors/style:
;     These are built into Jass Editor.exe and can't be changed through this file

; NOTE: NEVER make the first character of a line blank (eg. a space).
